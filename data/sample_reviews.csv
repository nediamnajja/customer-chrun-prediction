ANONYMOUS	19/02/2020	Tunis	X	5	Best Account	Currently I'm holding a salary account from X bank which I am operating from the year of 2015. Its mandatory to maintain a minimum balance of Rs. 20000. When i visited their branch the response is good and the staffs are very helpful. The branch is not that much crowded and hardly I need to wait only for 15 minutes.	https://static.bankbazaar.com/images/common/bank-logo/X.png	Blown Away!	0

ANONYMOUS	01/03/2020	Tunis	X	4	Good Account	I never interacted with the Xcall centre people till now for any kind of enquiry in my savings account. Last 5 years before, i have opened this account because its a zero balance maintenance account. Branch service is good. Bank always has a rush and there is a long queue to wait. Some staffs are very rude to the customer which can be improved.	https://static.bankbazaar.com/images/common/bank-logo/X-4.png	Great!	0
